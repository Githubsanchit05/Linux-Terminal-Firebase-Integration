This task is very useful for young engineers to learn the use cases of linux and get the importance of android and linux integration.
In this i'll design the linux + flutter integration to display the live running linux commands in android applpication. 
And get the successful outputs of the same commands and print it on the screen.
To get succeed it we need to set up the ip address using linux terminal in linux operating system and get proper configured the basic and essential use cases needed.
I also use python script in it to get secceed the app and successfully launched the app in my android emulator.
